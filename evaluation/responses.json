    "generated_answer": "Asthma attacks are triggered by irritation of inflamed airways.  In allergic asthma, inhaled allergens (e.g., pollen, dust, animal dander, mold) cause an allergic reaction.  Other triggers include physical activity, respiratory infections, and exposure to tobacco smoke.  These irritants cause bronchoconstriction (tightening of airway muscles), airway swelling, and mucus overproduction.",
    "context_used": [
      "asthma is a breathing disorder characterized by inflammation of the airways and recurrent episodes of breathing difficulty. these episodes, sometimes referred to as asthma attacks, are triggered by irritation of the inflamed airways. in allergic asthma, the attacks occur when substances known as allergens are inhaled, causing an allergic reaction. allergens are harmless substances that the body's immune system mistakenly reacts to as though they are harmful. common allergens include pollen, dust, animal dander, and mold. the immune response leads to the symptoms of asthma. allergic asthma is the most common form of the disorder. a hallmark of asthma is bronchial hyperresponsiveness, which means the airways are especially sensitive to irritants and respond excessively. because of this hyperresponsiveness, attacks can be triggered by irritants other than allergens, such as physical activity, respiratory infections, or exposure to tobacco smoke, in people with allergic asthma. an asthma attack is characterized by tightening of the muscles around the airways ( bronchoconstriction ), which narrows the airway and makes breathing difficult. additionally, the immune reaction can lead to swelling of the airways and overproduction of mucus. during an attack, an affected individual can experience chest tightness, wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing. over time, the muscles around the airways can become enlarged ( hypertrophied ), further narrowing the airways. some people with allergic asthma have another allergic disorder, such as hay fever ( allergic rhinitis ) or food allergies. asthma is sometimes part of a series of allergic disorders, referred to as the atopic march. development of these conditions typically follows a pattern, beginning with eczema ( atopic dermatitis ), followed by food allergies, then hay fever, and finally asthma. however, not all individuals with asthma have progressed through the atopic march, and not all individuals with one allergic disease will develop others.",
      "the exact cause of asthma isn't known. researchers think some genetic and environmental factors interact to cause asthma, most often early in life. these factors include : an inherited tendency to develop allergies, called atopy ( at - o - pe ) parents who have asthma certain respiratory infections during childhood contact with some airborne allergens or exposure to some viral infections in infancy or in early childhood when the immune system is developing if asthma or atopy runs in your family, exposure to irritants ( for example, tobacco smoke ) may make your airways more reactive to substances in the air. some factors may be more likely to cause asthma in some people than in others. researchers continue to explore what causes asthma. the [UNK] hygiene hypothesis [UNK] one theory researchers have for what causes asthma is the [UNK] hygiene hypothesis. [UNK] they believe that our western lifestylewith its emphasis on hygiene and sanitationhas resulted in changes in our living conditions and an overall decline in infections in early childhood. many young children no longer have the same types of environmental exposures and infections as children did in the past. this affects the way that young children's immune systems develop during very early childhood, and it may increase their risk for atopy and asthma. this is especially true for children who have close family members with one or both of these conditions.",

( angina is chest pain or discomfort. ) obesity also can lead to heart failure. this is a serious condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs. high blood pressure blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as theheart pumps blood. if this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can damage the body in many ways. your chances of having high blood pressure are greater if you're overweight or obese. stroke being overweight or obese can lead to a buildup of plaque in your arteries. eventually, an area of plaque can rupture, causing a blood clot to form. if the clot is close to your brain, it can block the flow of blood and oxygen to your brain and cause a stroke. the risk of having a stroke rises as bmi increases. type 2 diabetes diabetes is a disease in which the body's blood glucose, or blood sugar, level is too high. normally, the body breaks down food into glucose and then carries it to cells throughout the body. the cells use a hormone called insulin to turn the glucose into energy. in type 2 diabetes, the body's cells don't use insulin properly. at first, the body reacts by making more insulin. over time, however, the body can't make enough",

      "the best way to treat hypersensitivity pneumonitis ( hp ) is to avoid the antigen that caused it. ( an antigen is a substance that your body reacts against, such as molds, dusts, and chemicals. ) in acute ( short - term ) hp, symptoms usually go away once you're no longer in contact with the antigen. in chronic ( ongoing ) hp, you may need medicines to relieve your symptoms. people who have chronic hp may develop pulmonary fibrosis. this is a condition in which tissue deep in your lungs becomes scarred over time. people who have this condition may need further treatment, such as oxygen therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation ( rehab ). avoiding antigens once the antigen that caused the hp and its source are found, you can take steps to avoid it. if hp is caught early, avoiding the antigen may be the only treatment you need. avoiding an antigen may be easier at home than at work. for example, if your pet bird, moldy carpet, or hot tub is the source of the antigen, you can remove it from your home. if your heating system is the source of the antigen, you can have your system properly serviced. however, if the antigen is at work, you may need to talk with your supervisor about your condition and ways to protect yourself. for example, masks or personal respirators may help protect you from antigens in the air. ( a personal respirator is a device that helps filter the air you breathe in. ) some people who have hp may need to move to a different home or change jobs to avoid antigens. after hurricanes, for example, some people have to move from their homes to avoid molds that could harm their lungs. however, moving and changing jobs sometimes isn't possible. medicines and other treatments if you have chronic hp, your doctor may prescribe medicines called corticosteroids. these medicines reduce lung inflammation. prednisone is an example of a corticosteroid. long - term",
